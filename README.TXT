A Search Interface for Health

This project is based on the User-Centred Health Information Retrieval Task 2 at the CLEF eHealth 2015
workshop, which seeks to investigate the effectiveness of information retrieval systems when searching for med-
ical information on the web, with the aim to support the research and development of search engines designed to
aid health information seeking.
